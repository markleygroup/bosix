# Boston Internet Exchange (BOSIX) IRR Queries

The BOSIX route servers only accept validated routes in the IRR maintained by [Merit RADb](https://www.radb.net/). Twice daily, we query the list of participant ASNs against this database and publish those results here. We then build prefix lists based on the aggregated results of those queries. As a result, our route servers only accept prefixes present in these queries. If you're unsure as to which prefix lists we're currently importing, you may find the list here.
